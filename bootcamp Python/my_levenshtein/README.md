# Welcome to My Levenshtein
a function that represents how similar two strings are it is found by comparing two strings and comparing the difernce
Your function must take in 2 strings with the exact number of characters and return an integer representing the difference between them
## Task
Your job is to write an algorithm that calculates the Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number between two words
Your function must take in 2 strings with the exact number of characters and return an integer representing the difference between them
## Description
my job is to write an algorithm that calculates the Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number between two words.

The Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number is simple: it's a value that represents how similar two given strings are.
It is found by comparing two strings and returning the difference between them.

## Installation
it returns an iterger represinting the deference  betwen two strings  if the parameters are not thesme it will return 1
The Qwasar version of a Levenshteine

## Usage
it is used to see the difernce between  it can also be used to measure the difernece between two sequence The Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number is simple: it's a value that represents how similar two given strings are.
It is found by comparing two strings and returning the difference between them.
