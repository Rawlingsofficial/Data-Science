# Welcome to My Mobapp Studio
Description 
Welcome!
We are very pleased to hired as  Data Scientist here at My MobApp Studio. As I told you during your very first interview, data science is very new for us but you succeeded to convinced that it's one of the key factor to be successful in our digital world, as you said: data is life.
Last management meeting, we decided we will allocate resource to create a new mobile app and I have to say that I have already received multiple emails showing the enthusiasm from our employees who wants to be part of the team.
We have all in-house the different skills we need to make this project a success (marketing, design, game design, software engineer)
Before moving forward, I will need a report on the market. In order to complete our portfolio, this new App will be first publish on the Google Play Store, so you can focus your research on it.
I will just shoot some questions here:
What is the size of the market? numbers of download and $
Same question but per category? (percentages please)
Depending on each category, what are the ratio of download per app?
Any additional information you will find useful for us to take the right decision.
I remembered you told me you are also a developer, I'm myself an old developer, so I'm thinking maybe if you can build some code it would be great and display your results on the terminal.
I will invite my vp marketing and vp designer to the meeting, formatting will be a real plus, and if they have additional questions be ready to jump back in the code.
Best,  
## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
We are expecting two files:
First will be your notebook jupyter with your calculation You will have to implement multiple functions:
load_dataset()
Analysis
print_summarize_dataset(dataset)
clean_dataset(dataset)
print_histograms(dataset)
compute_correlations_matrix(dataset)
print_scatter_matrix()
Second will be a report. You will publish it on any blog platform of your choice.
To drive your Analysis:
Plot with bar diagram the most populars paid apps of Family category
Plot with a pie diagram the most popular genres according to the number of installations from paid family
An array with the number of installation per category
Plot a pie with the number of installation per category
Plot a bar with the mean price per category
Most expensive apps per category
## Description
How have you solved the problem?
started by downloadind the the dataset reqired for this project, then on my jupyternotebook
instaled the required libries and made sure the perdom as expected, ran some test, load the dataset, preproces it made analysis,correlat and made futheranalysis 
check hub and block post for more infomation
## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
installed the needed libries for the project 
!pip install pandas
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install numpy
!pip install seaborn 
## Usage
How does it work?
```
load_dataset() : loads the data in the csv file
def print_summarize_dataset() : sumarize the datase and print varios statistics, like the data infomation , dataset shape , missing valuses.
def clean_dataset(gp_play_df) : cleans all noice in dataset for futher analysis
def print_histograms(gp_play_df): this plots function and plots infomation in the dataset
def compute_correlations_matrix(gp_play_df): compute correlation matrix and prints result
def print_scatter_matrix: plots a scater matrix
def find_most_expensive_apps : finds the most expensive apps and by their categories and print the top ones

```
