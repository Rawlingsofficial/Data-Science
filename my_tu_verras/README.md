## Task
The problem is to build a model that can predict house prices based on predefined criteria using the Boston housing dataset.

## Description
Data Understanding: Understanding the structure and relationships within the dataset, identifying important features, and dealing with any missing or noisy data.

Model Selection: Deciding on the appropriate model for the prediction task. While linear regression is a good starting point, exploring and experimenting with other regression models like decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting might improve the predictive performance.

Feature Engineering: Transforming or creating new features that may better capture the relationships between the input features and the target variable.

Model Evaluation: Choosing suitable evaluation metrics and ensuring that the model is not overfitting or underfitting the data.

## Installation
The installation of the libraries such as seaborn, scikit-learn for the modeling

## Usage
Here's an example of how you can use the Boston housing price prediction model in your project:
